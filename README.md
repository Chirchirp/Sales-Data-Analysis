## 4. Data Preprocessing (ETL Process)
### 1.	Load Data
o	Review the files in Excel and complete initial preprocessing using SQL Server Managemnt Studio.
o	Use Power Query Editor for transformations and to create visualization.
### 2.	Data Cleaning
o	Remove duplicates using:
o	Handle missing values:
- Replace NULLs in numeric fields with averages.
- Replace NULLs in categorical fields with "Unknown".
### 3.	Data Transformation
o	Convert Date column to Date format.
o	Create new calculated columns:

### 4.	Data Integration
o	Append all country sales datasets into a GlobalSales table:

 ## 5. Data Modelling in Power BI
‚Ä¢	Establish relationships between tables (Fact Table: GlobalSales, Dimension Tables: Customers, Products, Stores).
